/**
 * The parts bin: what you have decided to order.
 *
 * Persisted, because it is the one piece of state with real work in it. A
 * decoded VIN can be typed again in seconds and a plate is two clicks; a bin
 * assembled across a dozen plates is not, and losing it to a reload would be
 * the worst thing this interface could do.
 *
 * The component that renders this is `PartsBin.svelte`, not `Bin.svelte`: a
 * component named `Bin` and a store named `bin` differ only in case, and on a
 * case-insensitive filesystem `./bin.svelte` then resolves to either one.
 *
 * Keyed by part number, not by part-name code. The same number appears under
 * different codes on different plates — a bolt is a bolt — and someone adding
 * it twice means "two of them", not "two lines that happen to match". Adding an
 * existing number therefore raises its quantity and keeps the first line's
 * provenance, since that is where the part was actually found.
