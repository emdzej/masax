/**
 * Notes on part numbers.
 *
 * `MS240141` is `BOLT,FUEL FILLER PIPE` in the catalogue, which does not tell
 * you it is M6×10. That knowledge comes from having had the part in your hand,
 * the catalogue has nowhere to put it, and it is exactly what you want the next
 * time the number comes up.
 *
 * Keyed by part number rather than by part-name code, and deliberately not
 * scoped to a catalogue or model: a bolt is the same bolt on every plate it
 * appears on, and a note that only showed up on the plate where it was written
 * would be worth much less.
 *
 * These are the user's own words, and the only copy of them is this browser's
 * `localStorage` — which a cleared cache takes with it. Hence import and
 * export: the notes are worth backing up in a way nothing else in masax is,
 * because everything else can be re-derived from the discs.
