/**
 * Markup inside a translated sentence.
 *
 * Plain functions in a plain module, deliberately: they are pure, and a
 * `.svelte.ts` module cannot be imported by a test without the Svelte
 * compiler in the way.
 *
 * Two strings need a fragment of themselves styled — a catalogue name in mono,
 * a filename as code. The obvious alternative is to hand the translator three
 * pieces and hope they reassemble in their language's word order, which for
 * Polish they will not: `opened X from Y` becomes `otwarto X na podstawie: Y`
 * and the styled piece moves.
 *
 * So the sentence stays whole in the JSON with its `{{placeholders}}`, and the
 * value passed for a styled placeholder is `slot(name)` — a sentinel that
 * survives interpolation and that `segments` then splits on. The sentinel is a
 * NUL, which cannot occur in a translation or in catalogue text.
